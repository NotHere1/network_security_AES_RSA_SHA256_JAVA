RSA KEY

The RSA keys for both clients were generated using a java file named Generate_RSA_Key_Pair.java. 


RSA KEY

The RSA keys for both clients were generated using a java file named Generate_RSA_Key_Pair.java. 

The program uses the native java KeyPairGenerator class to create both the RSA public and private keys for both clients. I ran the program twice, each time generated a new key pair  for each of the client.

[important]
In order for the program to run correctly, each client’s RSA key pair must reside on the same directory as the client#.java file. 

The RSA key pairs names are client1_public.key, client1_private.key, client2_public.key, and client2_private.key

HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAMS

The program is consists of three main java files, the [server.java], [client1.java], and [client2.java]. 

The program can be compiled using the ‘make’ command. The program must be started in the following order:

Server:
java server <port> <mode>

Client1
java client1 <server hostname> <port>

Client2
java client2 <server hostname> <port> <16 char pwd> <filepath>

A file name ‘serverdata’ must reside in the same working directory as the server.java file.

EXTERNAL FILES

AES.java, RSA.java, and Client_Handler.java

AES.java and RSA.java
External files used by both client1 and client2 to handle all the crypto functionalities.

Client_Handler.java 
A helper class for the server.java file. It performs all the basic file transformation tasks for the server.java file.
